Daniel Friederich was influenced by the legendary French luthier Robert Bouchet and has established himself as one of the most respected and influential luthiers in the world. Based out of France, Daniel Friederich made a name for himself with not only the silky, responsive tone of his instruments with powerful basses which project even in a large hall, but also with the graceful body shape and distinctive carved headstock adorning his guitars. The Luthier Select Friederich model salutes these construction methods, utilizing Friederich’s seven-fan bracing pattern with delicately, hand-carved Spruce braces and a solid Canadian Cedar top. Featuring elegantly grained solid rosewood back and sides with rosewood binding, the Friederich’s understated beauty is made real with an intricate wood rosette and iconic carved headstock. The Friederich is finished using an ultra-thin Polyurethane finish to protect the delicate instrument without impeding the vibration of the soundboard. Complete with an included Deluxe Humidified Archtop wood case, the Luthier Select Friederich offers players a chance to enjoy the exemplary sound and feel of one of history’s premier luthiers.
