GC5-NAT
The GC5 is an elegant classical guitar that features deluxe cosmetic appointments, solid-top construction and a warm, resonant sound that will bring out the best in your music.

An ideal choice for players looking for a refined and well-balanced classical guitar, the GC5 combines a fan-braced solid spruce top with black walnut back and sides to produce all of the rich, nylon-string tone players expect from a Takamine classical guitar. The comfortable mahogany neck and laurel fingerboard provide great feel and playability, while the dovetail neck joint provides superior wood-to-wood contact for better resonance and excellent structural stability.

Other great features include a beautiful inlaid mosaic rosette, synthetic bone nut and bridge saddle, laurel headcap, gold tuners with white pearl buttons and a luxurious gloss finish.
