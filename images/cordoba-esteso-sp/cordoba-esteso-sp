Domingo Esteso is considered one of the greatest Spanish luthiers of the 20th century, with a career that began in the 1890s, and continued through the 1930s. Created after extensive study of Domingo Esteso’s guitars, the Luthier Select Esteso mirrors the lightweight and responsive volume produced by the Spanish luthier’s famous guitars. Available with a European Spruce or Canadian Cedar top, the delicately, hand-carved spruce bracing works with the premium quality top woods to recreate the immaculate, full tone synonymous with guitars built by Esteso himself. Solid Pau Ferro back and sides provide the tonal pallet of Rosewood, but offer lighter weight and beautiful figure. Flamed Maple binding and a unique rosette with mother-of-pearl inlay, the kind of intricacy that was reserved for Esteso’s top of the line instruments, compliment the rich coloring of the Pau Ferro. The Estesto is finished using an ultra-thin Polyurethane finish to protect the delicate instrument without impeding the vibration of the soundboard. Complete with an included Deluxe Humidified Archtop wood case, the Cordoba Esteso CD (Cedar Top) and Esteso SP (Spruce top) offer players a chance to enjoy the exemplary sound and feel of one of history’s premier luthiers.
